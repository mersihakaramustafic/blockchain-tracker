# Blockchain Tracker

Blockchain Tracker is tracking the number of UserOperation Event per duration (hour/day/week) on Polygon Mainnet, storing data in database, and visualizing the data.

Data is stored in PostgreSQL, which is hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/).

Biconomy Bundler adresses are imported from ERC4337 CSV file into database, so we can check which from_to address are part of Biconomy Bundler addresses.

Data is visualized through charts in Grafana.
