# Blockchain Tracker

Blockchain Tracker monitors the number of UserOperation Events on the Polygon Mainnet, segmented by duration (hour/day/week). The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/), and visualized using Grafana.

Biconomy Bundler addresses are imported from an ERC4337 CSV file into the database, enabling identification of from_to addresses that are part of the Biconomy Bundler addresses.

Data import processes are automated through GitHub Actions.
