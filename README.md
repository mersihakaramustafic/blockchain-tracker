# Blockchain Tracker

Blockchain Tracker monitors the number of UserOperation Events on the Polygon Mainnet, segmented by duration (hour/day/week). The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is hosted on [Neon](https://neon.tech/), and visualized using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). UserOperation Events are tracked through [Infura API](https://www.infura.io/).

Biconomy Bundler addresses are imported from an ERC4337 CSV file into the database, enabling identification of from_to addresses that are part of the Biconomy Bundler addresses.

Data import processes are automated through GitHub Actions.


## Database Setup

To create a PostgreSQL database in [Neon](https://neon.tech/), follow these steps:

1. Establish a PostgreSQL database within the Neon platform.
2. Once the database is created, execute the following SQL scripts located in the "database setup queries" folder to create the necessary tables:
- `create_table_biconomy_bundlers.sql`
- `create_table_blockchain_tracker.sql`


## Environment Variables

To run this project locally, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file:

`INFURA_API_KEY`

`PSQL_CONNECTION_STRING`

INFURA_API_KEY is generated on [infura.io](https://www.infura.io/). For the purpose of this project, I stored the environment variables in Github -> Settings -> Secrets and Variables, so Github Actions can be run.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mersihakaramustafic/blockchain-tracker.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd blockchain-tracker
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the program

```bash
  python main.py
```


## Dashboard Implementation

To create charts in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), please follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an account on Grafana.
2. Create a new dashboard.
3. Generate the charts by executing the queries located in the "grafana queries" folder.
